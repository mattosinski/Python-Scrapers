Jami Bernard	 It's about time Warner Bros. revived Bugs. He was the most irreverent, intelligent, sophisticated and appealing cartoon character ever to defy gravity.
Brian Orndorf	 I'm certainly not a fan of Space Jam, but it's hard to deny its rich tapestry of questionable ideas. 
David Nusair	 A silly, forgettable comedy...
Peter Canavese	 If you weren't a kid when you first saw Space Jam, you're a lot less likely to find it palatable. [Blu-ray]
David Gurney	 Live-action/animation mix is good fun for kids.
Jonathan Rosenbaum	 Simpler and cruder than Who Framed Roger Rabbit in terms of story and technique, this is still a great deal of fun, confirming that Jordan is every bit as mythological a creature as Daffy Duck or Yosemite Sam.

Todd McCarthy	 Cute, rambunctious, generally amusing rather than outright funny, this clever mix of live action, highlighted by the unequaled skills of basketball superstar Michael Jordan, and animated Looney Tunes antics will be a must-see for kids.
Rita Kempley	 Sufferin' succotash!
NA	 Sufferin' succotash!
Robin Clifford	 What I miss most of all is the absence of the late, great Mel Blanc.
Judith Egerton	 Space Jam isn't exactly a slam dunk. It's more of a graceful tip-in by Michael Jordan, with a snazzy assist by Bugs Bunny.
Ryan Cracknell	 Succeeds in reintroducing the Looney Tunes name, but fails to capture the imagination and sharpness that defined them originally.
John J. Puccio	 Space Jam is harmless kiddie fare, but it may not be every adult's idea of a good time.
Janet Maslin	 This film was made very quickly by animation standards, and the haste shows.
Robert Roten	 It's a good effort, but not up to the level of the best Disney cartoon feature.
Rob Vaux	 An empty, soulless corporate product, designed for one purpose: to separate us from our wallets.
Margaret A. McGurk	 Technical spectacle amounts do nothing without a good story.
Clint Morris	 A splendid mish-mash of comedy and live-action.

Clint Morris	 A splendid mish-mash of comedy and live-action.
Marty Mapes	 This movie has all the wit of the original Warner Brothers Cartoons, and a few updated jabs at modern society.
Eugene Novikov	 Pitiful live-action/animation mix proves only that MJ can't act and that Coca Cola can peddle its advertising to children in the form of a 90-minute sham.
Peter Stack	 It's the first time either Jordan or Bugs has had a starring role on the big screen. It's gimmicky Saturday-morning cartoon wackiness in your face -- funny, but brain-deadening.
Pablo Villaa	 O erro mais grave dos roteiristas foi confundir a identidade do verdadeiro astro do filme: a histria deveria girar em torno de Pernalonga, e no de Michael Jordan.
James Kendrick	 The negatives in this film far outweigh any of the positives.
Kevin Thomas	 Space Jam is no Who Framed Roger Rabbit, but it works well enough.
James Berardinelli	 This movie, which could just as easily be called The Michael Jordan Worship Show, plays like a 90-minute homage to His Airness, selling his every virtue.
Milo Miles	 The climactic game in Space Jam goes slack repeatedly.
Roger Ebert	 It's an inspired way to use, and kid, Jordan's image while at the same time updating Bugs Bunny & Company to doing battle in the multizillion-dollar animation sweepstakes.
Desson Thomson	 Jordan has immense likability, and his extraordinary talents need no further adulation.
NA	 Jordan has immense likability, and his extraordinary talents need no further adulation.
Steve Rhodes	 I think the show is good fun, and I believe your family will too.
Marjorie Baumgarten	 Space Jam is, perhaps, best viewed as a 'package,' something put together by agents and dealmakers rather than filmmakers.
Chris Hicks	 Why do we have to have jokes about spitting and flatulence and other vulgarisms in a movie aimed at children?
Mike Clark	 The movie's undermining flaw is its lack of screen magic (and first-rate cartoon gags) that Who Framed Roger Rabbit had throughout.
Pete Croatto	 No matter if you're a basketball fan, a cartoon fan, or a movie fan, Space Jam offers little that will excite you or involve you. You'd get more excitement watching a local pick-up game.
Bruce Westbrook	 In basketball terms, Space Jam is more akin to the 'garbage time' that concludes lopsided games, when reckless playing is no substitute for the real thing.
Gregory Lewis	 What delights is the interaction between Jordan and our favorite cartoon characters. Appearances by Larry Bird and Bill Murray add nice touches, too.
Scott Renshaw	 How sad that a brilliant comic creation like Bugs Bunny has to ride shotgun with a wooden basketball star, all to provide a set of collector's cups.
